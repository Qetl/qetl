## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - "Foundation Release"

This is the initial release of the QETL SDK, providing a solid foundation for programmatic interaction with QETL quantum processing pipelines. The SDK follows a phased approach:

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Local execution with programmatic interface
- Wrap existing YAML pipeline runner with modern Python SDK
- Provide immediate value to users with local QETL installations
- Establish patterns and interfaces for future cloud integration

**Phase 2 (Upcoming)**: Cloud backend development
- Build cloud infrastructure for job execution
- Implement REST API and authentication
- Add advanced monitoring and management features

**Phase 3 (Future)**: Unified local/cloud experience
- Seamless switching between local and cloud modes
- Advanced collaboration and sharing features
- Enterprise-grade monitoring and management

This release enables immediate productivity for QETL users while laying the groundwork for the full enterprise cloud architecture.
